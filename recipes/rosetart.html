    <h1>Apple Rose Tart</h1>
    <img src="/home/odin/repos/odin-recipes/rosetart.webp" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An apple and walnut custard tart. Use apples with color, like Jazz™ or Pink Lady®. Evenly slicing the apples helps with the overall look and presentation. Tempering the egg is absolutely crucial for this recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <il>5 apples, quartered and thinly sliced</li>
        <il>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon allspice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 apples, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Add butter and egg; mix with a fork until crumbly. Work dough with your hands until fully blended. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll dough out to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place crust in the pie plate and prick with a fork.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place sliced apples, sugar, butter, water, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves in a large pot; cook over medium heat until apples start to release their juices and are just malleable enough to curve while still holding their shape, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove apple slices to a plate, reserving cooking juices in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add diced apples to the cooking juices and bring to a boil. Cook until apples are mushy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer mushy apples to a medium saucepan. Place walnuts in the bowl of a food processor; process until finely ground. Add nuts to the apples; stir until a paste forms. Add cream; bring to a boil. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg thoroughly in a small glass bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the hot cream mixture, whisking vigorously to make sure the egg doesn't curdle. Repeat twice more. Pour egg mixture into the saucepan; mix to incorporate. Allow custard to cool, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Spread cooled custard evenly over the crust. Arrange apple slices on top, working from the outer edge to the center in concentric circles, overlapping the slices to look like a rose.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 50 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
